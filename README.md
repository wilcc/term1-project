# Limit Reservation

Welcome to Limit Reservation

The intended purpose of this website is to make reservation to multiple restaurants for users and can be tracked easily so they don't have to worry about miss their reservation to their favorite restaurant


First user should login before they start make reservation.(Not working right now!)

By clicking the menu button on the top left corner a menu of suggested restaurants will pop out so user can pick from the suggestion if they don't already know which restaurant to pick.

By filling out the whole form and click the submit button, the reservation information will be displayed in a table on button, only the necessary information would be displayed, ie first name and last name would not be displayed since user know their own name and that information is strictly for restaurant to use.

User can simply cancel their reservation by clicking the cancel reservation button.
